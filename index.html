            <p>Lyrics<br>
                So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
Jump then we think, leave it all in the game of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids</p>


<h3 id="Im Good">Im Good</h3>
    <p>Lyrics<br>

        If I don't catch a break
If I'm in seventh place
Trust me I'm good
Yeah I don't need a name
I'll be doing fine in a 2005 car in cheap clothes

Yeah I've had a couple deals
A couple court appeals
Spent some time erasing
No drink here is wasted
I don't give a fuck about what daddy gave you
No ain't got no patience

Yeah I ain't got no time, I'm just living life
I ain't gotta prove shit
I don't wanna move quick
Take my name off the magazine page and put the new kids

I'm singing ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, I'm good
I'm singing ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, I'm good
Got friends and family, they don't fail me
Keep your check, bitch I'm prevailing
Ooh, ooh, I'm good

Yeah falling asleep
Awake in a dream
Please leave me here now
Yeah don't even speak
All of my friends who were taken too young are still in this place

Sure, I understand
There's much to repair
I'm dreading this process
Just counting my losses
I won't forget all of the people that pushed me through the worst phase

Yeah I ain't got no time
I'm just living life
I ain't gotta prove shit
I don't wanna move quick
Delete my name from the depths of your brain I'm begging please, please, please, please, please

I'm singing ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, I'm good
I'm singing ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, I'm good
Got friends and family, they don't fail me
Keep your check, bitch I'm prevailing
Ooh, ooh, I'm good
