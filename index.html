            <h3>Lyrics</h3><br>
    I think you are (you are) something special<br>
    I take you on a shopping spree<br>
    'Cause I'm so into you<br>
    I'm so into you (I love you, baby)<br>
    I'm so into you (oh, my)<br>
    I'm so into you, baby (to you, baby)<br>
    What you like? What you wear?<br>
    Say the name, say the price, put them diamonds on your ear<br>
    Shinin' like a chandelier<br>
    What's your thoughts? What's your fears?<br>
    Yeah, I need that real love<br>
    I'm talkin' Bobby and Whitney<br>
    You don't gotta worry 'bout nothin' as long as you with me<br>
    'Cause shit could get sticky, that's why I keep a glizzy<br>
    Ride around through my city<br>
    Fuck Kassandra, Kanisha, Kanika and Tisha, Lisa and Tisha, ah (hoes)<br>
    Fuck them hoes 'cause I don't need them, all them bitches treeshas<br>
    They ain't in the field, they on the bleachers, ah (treeshas)<br>
    On your back, I start applying that lotion<br>
    So deep, I'ma go in, pullin' all on your sewin'<br>
    I'm Pop Smoke, what'd you know of my governments<br>
    All that gangster shit, she be lovin' it<br>
    She love how I'm thuggin' it<br>
    Shawty brown and petite, fly and discreet, a demon in the sheets<br>
    Mother was a lawyer, her father the police<br>
    They be working long hours, so she always had the free<br>
    She said I could come with her if it get hot up in the streets<br>
    'Cause I'm a 'rilla in the jungle and shark up in the sea<br>
    She like, "Papi, you so fire, but get up out the streets"<br>
    I'm like, "Baby what you mean?" (what you mean?)<br>
    Look<br>
    I think you are (think)<br>
    You are (you are) something special (my girl)<br>
    I take you on a shopping spree<br>
    'Cause I'm so into you<br>
    I'm so into you (you are)<br>
    I'm so into you<br>
    I'm so into you, baby (baby)<br>
    Mm, baby (baby)<br>
    You are (you are) my girl (my girl)<br>
    You are (you are) my girl<br>
    I think you are (you are)<br>
    You are (you are) something special<br>
    I take you on a shopping spree<br>
    'Cause I'm so into you (baby)<br>
    I'm so into you (you are)<br>
    I'm so into you (my girl)<br>
    I'm so into you, baby (you are my girl)<br></p>

    If I don't catch a break<br>
    If I'm in seventh place<br>
    Trust me I'm good<br>
    Yeah I don't need a name<br>
    I'll be doing fine in a 2005 car in cheap clothes<br>
    Yeah I've had a couple deals<br>
    A couple court appeals<br>
    Spent some time erasing<br>
    No drink here is wasted<br>
    I don't give a fuck about what daddy gave you<br>
    No ain't got no patience<br>
    Yeah I ain't got no time, I'm just living life<br>
    I don't wanna move quick<br>
    Take my name off the magazine page and put the new kids<br>
    I'm singing ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, I'm good<br>
    I'm singing ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, I'm good<br>
    Got friends and family, they don't fail me<br>
    Keep your check, bitch I'm prevailing<br>
    Ooh, ooh, I'm good<br>
    Yeah falling asleep<br>
    Awake in a dream<br>
    Please leave me here now<br>
    Yeah don't even speak<br>
    All of my friends who were taken too young are still in this place<br>
    Sure, I understand<br>
    There's much to repair<br>
    I'm dreading this process<br>
    Just counting my losses<br>
    I won't forget all of the people that pushed me through the worst phase<br>
    Yeah I ain't got no time<br>
    I'm just living life<br>
    I ain't gotta prove shit<br>
    I don't wanna move quick<br>
    Delete my name from the depths of your brain I'm begging please, please, please, please, please<br>
    I'm singing ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, I'm good<br>
    I'm singing ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, I'm good<br>
    Got friends and family, they don't fail me<br>

        <h3>Lyrics</h3><br>
    You broke that bond, now when it come to you, my feelings weak<br>
    You let your selfish ways come in between our chemistry<br>
    Why you play with my heart and not show love consistently?<br>
    I put my life on the line, you wouldn't take that risk for me<br>
    Fucked up my choice, wish I could delete all our memories<br>
    Keep poppin' these pills, I hope it take away my misery<br>
    I got a dead soul, I been facing blunts of my enemies<br>
    Emotions bottled up, I don't know what's wrong and it's killing me<br>
    I cut so many off, my heart cold, it's December, B<br>
    My mind keep racing, I been overthinking, I don't get no sleep<br>
    You don't understand how hard it was, I swear this shit so deep<br>
    I made it to the top and they all look up in disbelief<br>
    They hate that I'm doin' better, they'd much rather get rid of me<br>
    I flex with no regrets 'cause they ain't show me no sympathy<br>
    I came a long way but I ain't as far as I'm finna be<br>
    I promise I'ma die a legend, I'ma make sure that you remember me<br>
    I used to daydream, I pictured everything so vividly<br>
    I had a feeling we'd be rich since the elementary<br>
    My peoples gone, got to witness everything they ain't get to see<br>
    Long live Maxine, I miss your love, wish you was here with me<br>
    You was a part of me, and since you left, I'm incomplete<br>
    My lifestyle used to be jump shots and sticking D<br>
    Life overwhelmed me, I said, "Fuck school", and hit the streets<br>
    I devoted my life to that corner just so I can get a G<br>
    Fuck a two-four, nigga, I ain't been home and it's been a week<br>
    We used to break down eight-balls, wishing we could get a key<br>
    Was tryna duck that indictment, the feds did a sweep<br>
    I hope you grippin' on your gun when them drillers creep<br>
    Lil' nigga grabbed his first glizzy, went on a killing spree<br>
    Caught him at that red light snoozin', he thought this shit was sweet<br>
    If he come from that other side, we make him rest in peace<br>
    I'm way too solid for the gimmicks, fuck the industry<br></p>

    Where is the time going again?<br>
    I lost a home, I lost a friend<br>
    Love's an ocean, whether you sink or swim<br>
    I gave you my best, was it enough?<br>
    Maybe the past is holding me up<br>
    I keep the memories with me, replay what was<br>
    So long, baby<br>
    Did you know, you saved me?<br>
    Silver line faded<br>
    But you know, I'll keep waiting<br>
    'Cause when I think of us<br>
    I always seem to smile<br>
    'Cause I was happy for awhile<br>
    I was happy for awhile, yeah<br>
    And sometimes love will leave you<br>
    Even when it's right<br>
    But I was happy for awhile<br>
    And I don't know how I'll smile again<br>
    Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh<br>
    Yeah, yeah<br>
    Remember your face, like it was here<br>
    I'm getting used to all of the tears<br>
    And I'm getting used to forever without you here<br>
    And I don't know how I'll smile again<br>
    Ask if I am good, I gotta pretend<br>
    I'm holding on to three words, I should have said<br>
    So long, baby<br>
    Did you know, you saved me?<br>
    Silver line faded<br>
    But you know, I'll keep waiting<br>
    'Cause when I think of us<br>

    Yeah, I'm outside in an AMG<br>
    Right outside, TT<br>
    Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah<br>
    Still with the dawgs that I grew beside<br>
    All the niggas 'round me ride or they die<br>
    Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by<br>
    I'm outside in an AMG, yeah<br>
    Right outside, TT<br>
    Too turnt, baby girl, you know me<br>
    Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die<br>
    Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by<br>
    Too turnt, baby girl, you know me<br>
    <br>
        [Verse 1]<br>
    I just caught a shawty off a finsta<br>
    Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw<br>
    Way that I been livin' unconventional<br>
    I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know<br>
    Certain things just started gettin' tenser<br>
    Think we need to have us an adventure<br>
    I could be your man but maybe down the road<br>
    Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome<br>
    Rather see my heart turn crystal<br>
    I can't even front like I don't miss ya<br>
    Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own<br>
    Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like<br>
        [Chorus]<br>
    I'm outside in an AMG<br>

    Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah<br>
    Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die<br>

        [Verse 2]<br>
    Heart's still on javelin, baby<br>
    Too turnt, baby girl, you know me<br>
    I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me<br>
    Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me<br>
    When it was you and me<br>
    I felt like I love you too much to change you<br>
    You believe in angles more than angels<br>
    Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you<br>
    But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you<br>
    Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you<br>
    Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you<br>
    Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry<br>
    I'm sorry<br>

        <h3>Lyrics</h3><br>
        [Verse 1: Jeremy Zucker]<br>
    I don't wanna smoke, I don't need a drink<br>
    Just tell me how you feel, tell me what you think<br>
    'Cause I've been on my own for a fuckin' while<br>
    And I don't need a girl, I just wanna smile<br>
    Gettin' my mind right<br>
    I'll wait 'til the time's right<br>
    I'm meanin' to tell you<br>
    Why it's hard to sleep at night<br>
    There's nothin' to fear now<br>
    Girl, we should be here now<br>
    So why don't you hear me out?<br>
    I'm saying<br>
    <br>
        [Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]<br>
    Talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
    And love is overrated in my mind<br>
    Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
    Just for tonight<br>
    <br>
        [Post-Chorus]<br>
    I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
    I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
    <br>
        [Verse 2: Jeremy Zucker]<br>
    I've been hella stressed, I would rather chill<br>
    I know you looked at me, wonder how I deal<br>
    But look inside my soul, I don't mean to front<br>
    'Cause really I don't know what the fuck I want<br>
    I remember when we were more than friends<br>
    I would just pretend, that was cold<br>
    After all this shit, I could not let you in<br>
    Summer went, saved up all the money<br>
    That I would have spent<br>
    On you, girl<br>

        [Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]<br>
    Talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
    And love is overrated in my mind<br>
    Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
    Just for tonight<br>
    <br>
    [Post-Chorus]<br>
    I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
    I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 3: blackbear]<br>
    Yeah, let's talk it out<br>
    Girl, time out<br>
    I know that you only with me for the clout, sit down<br>
    You had too much to drink<br>
    Maybe it's my fault<br>
    I remember you would pull up, pour up Hennessy askin' to smoke<br>
    No, no, there you go again<br>
    Mixin' blow with downers<br>
    Brand new hoes around ya<br>
    And when the night is done<br>
    You be hittin' my line<br>
    Tell me your phone at one percent<br>
    3:00 A.M., you wanna vibe<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]<br>
    Talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
    And love is overrated in my mind<br>
    Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
    Just for tonight<br></p>

        <h3>Lyrics</h3><br>
    I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999<br>
    Waiting for the exhale<br>
    I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well<br>
    I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale<br>
    Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well<br>
    Still no luck, but oh, well<br>
    I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail<br>
    Stress on my shoulders like a anvil<br>
    Perky got me itching like a anthill<br>
    Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill<br>
    Sometimes I don't know how to feel<br>
    Ring-ring, phone call from depression<br>
    You used my past and my memories as a weapon<br>
    On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh<br>
    Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them<br>
    This can't be real, is it fiction?<br>
    Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it<br>
    I cry out for help, do they listen?<br>
    I'ma be alone until it's finished<br>
    This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lyin'<br>
    I just don't want you to worry<br>
    This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em<br>
    'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me<br>
    I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale<br>
    Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well<br>
    Still no luck, but oh, well<br>
    I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail<br>
    It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil<br>
    Perky got me itching like a anthill<br>
    Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill<br>
    Sometimes I don't know how to feel<br>
    Sometimes I don't know how to feel<br>
    Let's be for real<br>
    If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here<br>
    But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah<br>
    I just told y'all my secret, yeah<br>
    It's tearing me to pieces<br>
    I really think I need them<br>
    I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me<br>
    This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lyin'<br>
    I just don't want you to worry<br>
    This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em<br>
    'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me<br>
    I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale<br>
    Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well<br>
    Still no luck, but oh, well<br>
    I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail<br>
    It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil<br>
    Perky got me itching like a anthill<br>
    Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill<br>
    Sometimes I don't know how to fee<br></p>

        <h3>Lyrics</h3><br>
        [Intro: beabadoobee]<br>
    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed<br>
    I'll make a cup of coffee for your head<br>
    It'll get you up and going out of bed<br>
<br>
    [Verse 1: Powfu]<br>
    Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away<br>
    I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days<br>
    I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it<br>
    I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect<br>
    I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health<br>
    When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else<br>
    'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done<br>
    Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son<br>
    I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed<br>
    I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again<br>
    My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings<br>
    Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending<br>
</p>
    [Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]<br>
    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed<br>
    I'll make a cup of coffee for your head<br>
    It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)<br>
    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed<br>
    I'll make a cup of coffee for your head<br>
    It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)<br>
<br>
    [Verse 2: Powfu]<br>
    I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up<br>
    When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up<br>
    Taking goofy videos and walking through the park<br>
    You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark<br>
    Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep<br>
    And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03<br>
    Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie<br>
    Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me<br>
<br>
    [Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]<br>
    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed<br>
    I'll make a cup of coffee for your head<br>
    It'll get you up and going out of bed<br>
    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed<br>
    I'll make a cup of coffee for your head<br>
    It'll get you up and going out of bed<br>
    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed<br>
    I'll make a cup of coffee for your head<br>
    It'll get you up and going out of bed<br>
    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed<br>
    I'll make a cup of coffee for your head<br>
    It'll get you up and going out of bed<br>
<br>
    [Outro: beabadoobee]<br>
    Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed<br>
    I'll make a cup of coffee for your head<br>
    It'll get you up and going out of bed    <br>
